# [ emoji decoder ] - proposal

As the title describes it, this `App` will allow the user to translate any messages received as `emoji`s and will show it in plain english, for example:
```
       👁 === I
       🐗 === bored
 👁 am 🐗 === I am bored
```
```
        🐳 === well
        👁 === I
        🙏 === hope
🐳 👁 🙏 so === well I hope so
```
```
         👁 === I
         🐝 === be
         🍁 === lieve
👁 🐝 🍁 you === I believe you
```
These examples below are just a few of the translation each emoji character will have.
By entering the emoji it will be able to translate directly to a word or part of a word which it will make it easier for the user to actually read any code emoji messages.
